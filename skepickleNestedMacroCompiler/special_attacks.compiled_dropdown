Any attack of opportunity made by anyone other than the defender against you has a 25% chance of accidentally targeting the defender instead&#44; and any attack of opportunity by anyone other than you against the defender likewise has a 25% chance of accidentally targeting you.
&nbsp;&nbsp;If you succeed you push him back 5 feet. If you wish to move with the defender&#44; you can push him back an additional 5 feet for each 5 points by which your check > defender’s check. You can’t&#44; however&#44; exceed your normal movement limit.
&nbsp;&nbsp;If you fail to beat the defender’s Strength check result&#44; you move 5 feet straight back to where you were before you moved into his space.

• Light weapons take a ``-4`` penalty on this roll.
• If the target item isn't a melee weapon&#44; defender takes a ``-4`` penalty on the roll.

• If you attempted the disarm unarmed&#44; you now have the weapon.
• If you were armed&#44; the defender's weapon is on the ground in the defender's square.
• If you failed the disarm&#44; defender may react and attempt to disarm you with opposed melee attack rolls&#44; and does not provoke an attack of opportunity.

Step One: (Attack of Opportunity)

Step Two: (Grab)
• Make a melee touch attack to grab the target:
&nbsp;&nbsp;Attack [[ 1d20 + [[@{meleeattackbonus}]][Melee Attack Bonus] ]] ≥ AC [[ [[1-?{Target Type (Ask GM)&#124;PC&#44;0&#124;NPC&#44;1&#125;]]*[[@{target|armorclass}]] + ?{Target Type (Ask GM)&#124;PC&#44;0&#124;NPC&#44;1&#125;*[[@{target|npcarmorclass}]] ]]
• If you fail to hit the target&#44; the grapple attempt fails.

Step Three: (Hold)
• Make an opposed grapple check as a free action:
&nbsp;&nbsp;Attacker [[ 1d20 + [[@{grapple}]][Grapple Check Modifier] ]] > [[ 1d20 + [[ [[1-?{Target Type (Ask GM)&#124;PC&#44;0&#124;NPC&#44;1&#125;]]*[[@{target|grapple}]] + ?{Target Type (Ask GM)&#124;PC&#44;0&#124;NPC&#44;1&#125;*[[@{target|npcgrapple}]] ]][Grapple Check Modifier] ]] Defender
• If you succeed&#44; you are now grappling and deal damage to target as if with an unarmed strike.
• If you lose&#44; you fail to start the grapple.
• In case of tie&#44; higher Grapple Check Modifier wins. If also tie&#44; roll again.

Step Four: (Maintain Grapple)
• To maintain the grapple for later rounds&#44; you must move into the target's space.

Step One: (Attack of Opportunity)

Step Two: (Opponent Avoids?)
• The defender has the option to simply avoid you. If he avoids you&#44; he doesn't suffer any ill effect and you may keep moving (You can always move through a square occupied by someone who lets you by.) The overrun attempt doesn't count against your actions this round (except for any movement required to enter the opponent's square).

Step Three: (Opponent Blocks?)
• If your opponent blocks you&#44; make a Strength check&#44; opposed by the defender's Dexterity or Strength check (whichever is higher):
&nbsp;&nbsp;Attacker [[ 1d20 + [[@{str-mod}]][Strength Modifier] ]] > [[ 1d20 + [[1-?{Target Type (Ask GM)&#124;PC&#44;0&#124;NPC&#44;1&#125;]]*[[ { @{target|str-mod}&#44;@{target|dex-mod} &#125;kh1]] + ?{Target Type (Ask GM)&#124;PC&#44;0&#124;NPC&#44;1&#125;*[[ { @{target|npcstr-mod}&#44;@{target|npcdex-mod} &#125;kh1]] ]] Defender

Step One: (Attack of Opportunity)

Step Two: (Opposed Rolls)
• Two-Handed weapons gain ``+4`` bonus.
• Light weapons take a ``-4`` penalty.
• If combatants differ in sizes&#44; larger gains ``+4`` per size category.

Step Three: (Consequences)
• If you beat the defender&#44; roll damage and deal it using information from [this table](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Sunder).&#125;&#125;|Trip,&{template:DnD35StdRoll&#125; {{pcflag=true&#125;&#125; {{name=**[Trip](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Trip)**&#125;&#125; {{subtags=@{character_name}&#125;&#125; {{check=**Trip check:**&#125;&#125; {{Opposing check=**See text**&#125;&#125; {{Duration=1 Std Action&#125;&#125; {{Provoke Attack of Opp=Yes&#125;&#125; {{checkroll=**See text**&#125;&#125; {{notes=
Step One: (Melee Attack)
• For normal trips&#44; make an unarmed melee touch attack:
&nbsp;&nbsp;Attack [[ 1d20 + [[@{meleeattackbonus}]] ]] ≥ AC [[ [[ [[1-?{Target Type (Ask GM)&#124;PC&#44;0&#124;NPC&#44;1&#125;]]*[[@{target|touchac}]] ]] + ?{Target Type (Ask GM)&#124;PC&#44;0&#124;NPC&#44;1&#125;*[[@{target|npctoucharmorclass}]] ]]
• If tripping with a weapon&#44; roll that as a melee touch attack.

Step Two: (Opposed Checks)
• Attacker makes a Strength check&#44; opposed by the defender's Dexterity or Strength check (whichever is higher):
&nbsp;&nbsp;Attacker [[ 1d20 + [[@{str-mod}]][Strength Modifier] ]] > [[ 1d20 + [[1-?{Target Type (Ask GM)&#124;PC&#44;0&#124;NPC&#44;1&#125;]]*[[ { @{target|str-mod}&#44;@{target|dex-mod} &#125;kh1]] + ?{Target Type (Ask GM)&#124;PC&#44;0&#124;NPC&#44;1&#125;*[[ { @{target|npcstr-mod}&#44;@{target|npcdex-mod} &#125;kh1]] ]] Defender
